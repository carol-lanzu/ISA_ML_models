# Naive Bayes Explained
Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on Baye's theorem and its commonly used for classification tasks. Before understanting about naive bayes algorithms let's first jump into [Baye's Theorem](baye's_theorem_explained.md).

Now that we understand the basis of bayes rule let's understand a litle more of naive-bayes.

Naive Bayes uses probability to predict which category a data point belongs to, considering that all features, this is the data's characterisctics or atributtes, are independent and this simplifies the computation significantly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Naive Bayes Classifier can predict at a faster speed than others classification algotithms because it's a simple probabilistic classifier and it doesn't have many parameters to build the ML models.
> - It is a probabilistic classifier because it assumes that one feature in the model is independent of existence of another feature. That means that each feature contributes to the predictions and has no relation between each other.

## Why the name *Naive Bayes*? ðŸ¤”
The term "Naive" comes from the fact that the model assumes that the presence of one feature does not affact other features, that the characteristic or attribute of the data are independent. And the "Bayes" part comes from to its basis in Bayes' Theorem.

## Types of Naive Bayes Model
There are 3 types for classification in this model
1. a
2. b
3. c
