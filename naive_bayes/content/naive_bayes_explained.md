# Naive Bayes Explained
Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ theorem and its commonly used for classification tasks. Before understanting about naive bayes algorithms let's first jump into Baye's Theorem.
## Baye's Theorem
Bayes theorem (also known as the Bayes Rule or Bayes Law) is used to determine the conditional probability of event A when event B has already occurred, it's a formula used to calculate the probability of an outcome given a known previus outcome that occured in similar circumstances.
> KEY TAKEAWAYS
> - Baye's Theorem can be used to revise a probability analysis based on new information.
> - It is commonly used in finance to calculate or update risk evaluation.
> - And it is also used in other fields, such as analyses of medical test results.
